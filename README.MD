# Surplus - The Dirty Story of One Cheat

## About the Project

**Surplus** is a "new" cheat for the game **survev.io**, which in reality is just a shameless fork of the cheat [**KrityHack**](https://github.com/Drino955/survev-krityhack). Its authors, **noam** and **mahdi**, stole the source code from [KrityHack](https://github.com/Drino955/survev-krityhack), slightly tweaked the UI, slapped on their own injection system, and started promote it under a new name, obfuscating everything to cover up their theft.

Their obfuscation? Just a lazy use of **js-confuser**, which caused insane lag. Even their users in chat constantly complained about the performance issues. After that, they were forced to lighten the obfuscation, but it didn‚Äôt save them‚Äîmy friend **askile** easily deobfuscated the whole mess (even at the peak obfuscation level of js-confuser in version 1.2 of the cheat).

## The Theft Story

Surplus isn‚Äôt an original project‚Äîit‚Äôs a dirty fork of KrityHack with minimal changes:  
![Surplus cheat](./images/surplus-menu.png)

- The functionality is copied 1:1.
- The UI was written using ChatGPT.
- The injection system is just prototype hooks that noam didn‚Äôt even know how to make‚Äîsomeone else spoon-fed him the idea.
- The core code was blatantly copied from the public KrityHack repository.
- They obfuscated it all to hide the theft.
- When the code got deobfuscated, they denied everything until they were cornered with no way out.

## God-Level Hypocrisy  

These two stole my code and then had the audacity to call it "shitcode," even though they used it in their own product. Surplus is just a repackaged KrityHack, made by two script kiddies.  
They use other people‚Äôs source code, rely on open-source projects, and learn from them, but not only do they fail to credit the original developers‚Äîthey outright deny it, shamelessly stealing code and passing it off as their own unique product. Since you didn‚Äôt want to release your source code, I‚Äôll do it for you.

## Important Info  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never get involved with noam and mahdi.** They are:  
- Thieves.  
- Scammers.  
- Liars.  
- Hypocrites.  
- Just toxic people you can‚Äôt even have a normal conversation with.  

They‚Äôve already screwed over dozens of people, and who knows what they‚Äôll do next. Don‚Äôt trust them, don‚Äôt download their stuff‚Äîit could easily contain malware. These kids have zero reputation.
